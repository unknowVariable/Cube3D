- create new struct t_img_data to store data of images created with mlx_new_image() . 
typedef struct s_img_data
{
	void	*img;
	char	*addr;
	int		width;
	int		height;
	int		bpp;
	int		line_len;
	int		endian;
}			t_img_data;


- removed the function init_config() function in main() because the struct config was already initialized with ft_bzero().

- the variables f_color and c_color in the struct config are now in type integer (int). They are now set in the function set_config_field() directly in the format int and not anymore set in the function render_scene().

- in parse_color_string_to_int() function i removed the check if the color is valid or not, because the check was done in the function set_config_field() who call is_valid_rgb() just above.

- in render_scene() i removed local creation of variables, now we use struct variables members to save lot of lines.

	in the structure t_config , i added the member t_img_data win to store the image data of the window (img, addr, bpp, edian....);
	int the structure t_mlx, i changed the type of the textures from void * to t_img_data .
